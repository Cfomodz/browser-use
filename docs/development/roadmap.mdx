### Agent

- [ ] Make agent 3x faster
- [ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

- [ ] Enable interaction with all UI elements
- [ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that any LLM can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

- [ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback

### User Experience

- [ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.

### Parallelization

- [ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

Big things coming soon!
