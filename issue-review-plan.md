# Issue Review Project Plan

## Objective
Collaboratively work through all 510 currently open issues, starting with the oldest (by creation date) and working toward newer ones. The goal is exhaustive review to identify issues we can meaningfully address, not necessarily to close all 510.

## Approach Philosophy
- **Thorough, not dismissive**: Even old issues deserve proper evaluation
- **Test-driven**: For bugs, attempt reproduction on current codebase
- **Collaborative**: Engage constructively with issue reporters
- **Context-aware**: Use full project history (codebase, docs, closed issues, PRs)
Install the deps and actually test it both ways. Also don't make any uneeded changes and be less verbose in any   │
│   future comments. Also less strictly formatted. More like a human 

## Workflow Structure

### Issue-by-Issue Approach
Rather than managing a 510-item todo list, we'll use a "next issue" tracking system:
- Track: "Last reviewed issue: #X (date created: YYYY-MM-DD)"
- Query: "What's the next oldest issue to review?"
- Work each issue as a focused mini-project

### Issue Categories & Handling

#### 1. Bugs/Problems
- **Process**: Attempt to reproduce on current codebase
- **If reproducible**: Document steps, assess severity, determine fix approach
- **If not reproducible**: 
  - Research what changed that might have fixed it
  - Comment thanking reporter, explain testing results on current version
  - Invite them to test current version and report back
  - Example comment template: "Hi @username, thanks for reporting this issue! I've tested this on our current version (vX.X.X) and wasn't able to reproduce the behavior you described. This might have been resolved by recent updates. Could you try the latest version and let us know if you're still experiencing this issue? If so, any additional details would be helpful."

#### 2. Feature Requests/Improvements
- **Process**: Evaluate against current roadmap and architecture
- **Consider**: Implementation complexity, user benefit, maintainability
- **Document**: Whether to pursue, defer, or decline with reasoning

#### 3. Documentation Issues
- **Process**: Check if documentation has been updated since issue creation
- **Fix**: Simple doc issues immediately
- **Plan**: Larger documentation overhauls

#### 4. Questions/Support
- **Process**: Provide current answers, check if question indicates missing docs
- **Follow-up**: Consider if FAQ or documentation improvements needed

## Research Resources
For each issue, consult:
- Current codebase state
- Project documentation
- Related closed issues
- Related closed/open PRs and their comments
- Git history around relevant code areas

## Progress Tracking
- **Current position**: Issue #[number] (created: [date])
- **Session notes**: Key findings, decisions made, actions taken
- **Categories**: Running count of issue types encountered
- **Outcomes**: Track resolution types (fixed, closed, deferred, etc.)

## Context Management Strategy
Each issue becomes its own focused session to avoid context bloat:
1. Load issue details and immediate context
2. Research relevant code/docs/history  
3. Make assessment and take action
4. Document decision and move to next

## Success Metrics
- **Coverage**: Progress through all 510 issues
- **Quality**: Thoughtful evaluation of each issue
- **Community**: Respectful, collaborative responses
- **Improvement**: Actual fixes/improvements where possible

## Questions for Refinement
1. Should we batch certain types of issues (e.g., all doc issues together)?
2. How do we handle issues that require significant investigation?
3. What's our approach for issues that might need community input?
4. Should we set a time limit per issue to maintain momentum?

## Technical Implementation Details

### Repository Setup
- **Source repo**: Query issues from `browser-use/browser-use` 
- **Fork repo**: Push branches to `cfomodz/browser-use` (this fork)
- **Branch naming**: `cfomodz-short-issue-name-{issue#}`
- **Branch management**: Each issue starts from fresh main branch, preserving only:
  - `issue-review-plan.md` (this file)
  - `issue-reviews.json` (tracking file)
  - Other meta-task files (not actual code changes)

### Issue Review Workflow
- **NO direct actions**: Don't post comments or close issues on GitHub
- **Document everything**: Record all intended actions in `issue-reviews.json`
- **JSON structure**: Track issue number, intended comment, intended result (closed/not planned/etc.)
- **Code changes**: Make actual fixes/improvements in branches when appropriate
- **Testing**: Install deps and test changes both ways as noted
- **Commit messages**: Keep commit messages very simple, 1 line

### Branch Management Process
1. **Check for previous work**: Before starting any issue, check `issue-reviews.json` to see if we've already reviewed/fixed/skipped this issue
2. Start each issue from clean main branch
3. Create new branch: `cfomodz-short-issue-name-{issue#}`
4. Make necessary changes/fixes
5. Push branch to cfomodz/browser-use fork
6. Document decision in issue-reviews.json

## Getting Started
1. Query GitHub API to get oldest open issues from browser-use/browser-use
2. Create issue-reviews.json tracking file
3. Start with issue #1 in that sorted list
4. Establish rhythm: research → assess → act → document → next

**Next Steps**: Implement the technical workflow and begin with the oldest open issue.
