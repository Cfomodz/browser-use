			"created_at": "2025-01-08T12:13:52Z",
			"category": "feature_request",
			"status": "implemented",
			"intended_comment": "Great suggestion! I've implemented endless loop detection that monitors recent actions and stops the agent when repeated patterns are detected. This includes configurable detection window and threshold settings, and works for scroll loops, repeated clicking, and other repetitive behaviors. The feature is enabled by default but can be configured via agent parameters.",
			"intended_result": "closed",
			"branch_created": "cfomodz-endless-loop-detection-191",
			"notes": "Implemented comprehensive loop detection with configurable parameters. Added detection for scroll loops, click loops, and other repetitive patterns. Feature prevents high LLM costs from infinite loops."
